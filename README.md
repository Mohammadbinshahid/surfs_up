## Purpose 

###The purpose of this analysis is to convince W. Avy to invest in our idea for Waves and Ice Cream. The key focus was to analyse whether data to establish feasibility of investing in this business by backing the business proposition with concrete analysis about weather data.

### As a continuation of our analysis, Mr. W Avy wanted to understand the weather patterns in Oahu to establish year round feasibility and was specifically interested in the months of June and December.

## Result
### The average temperature for December was 71 degrees, which is ~4 degrees lower than the average temperature in June of ~75 degrees. The standard deviation of temperature was 3.746 for December as compared to 3.257 in June. This shows that the weather deviation in December are much more volatile than December. Minimum temparature in December was 56 Degrees as compared to 64 Degrees in June. This shows that even on the coldest days, the temperature still remains reasonable in Ohao however because of more days where temperature is low, sales of icecreams may get impacted. Deviation in max temperature is only two degrees which shows that you get warm days in December as well which can be really good for business.

## Summary
### Looking at the above Analysis, it seems that the weather in Ohoa remains considerably good throughout the year. The difference in peak summer and winter months is not significant hence weather should not be a concern while analysing the business idea. To add more to the analysis, we could look at the number of days of precipitation throughout the year, continous rain can be a deterrent for the surfing business and may also impact icecream sales. Looking at humidity levels may also be useful as high humidity days may be really good for business.
